    "# Using Machine Learning Tools Assignment 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will apply some popular machine learning techniques to the problem of predicting bike rental demand. A data set has been provided containing records of bike rentals in Seoul, collected during 2017-18.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is divided into several tasks. Use the spaces provided in this notebook to answer the questions posed in each task. Note that some questions require writing a small amount of code and some require graphical results. It is your responsibility to make sure your responses are clearly labelled and your code has been fully executed (with the correct results displayed) before submission!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not** manually edit the data set file we have provided! For marking purposes, it's important that your code is written to run correctly on the original data file.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating graphical output, label is clearly, with appropriate titles, xlabels and ylabels, as appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 2 of the reference book is based on a similar workflow to this prac, so you may look there for some further background and ideas. You can also use any other general resources on the internet that are relevant although do not use ones which directly relate to these questions with this dataset (which would normally only be found in someone else's assignment answers). If you take a large portion of code or text from the internet then you should reference where this was taken from, but we do not expect any references for small pieces of code, such as from documentation, blogs or tutorials. Taking, and adapting, small portions of code is expected and is common practice when solving real problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code imports some of the essential libraries that you will need. You should not need to modify it, but you are expected to import other libraries as needed."
